To give a better idea of the direction I am heading for the project this is the current feature/development roadmap I am looking to follow:
  * Match the features of the existing Django Forms module
  * Integrate with .Net MVC
    * Support .Net MVC error collections
  * Support dynamic forms where form elements are added at run time
  * Support .Net data binding
More features will be added as I find a good use-case, if you have any requests please add a feature request via the Issue Tracker.
